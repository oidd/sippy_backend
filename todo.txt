- postgresql functions instead of hardcoded lines like
DB::select("SELECT ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(?, ?), 4326)", [$inp['latitude'] ?? $p->latitude, $inp['longitude'] ?? $p->longitude])[0]->st_setsrid
DB::select(
            'SELECT chunks.id as id
        FROM chunks
        WHERE ST_Intersects(chunks.geom, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(?, ?), 4326));', [$longitude, $latitude])[0]->id
and define them in database migration
- rename and refactor RequestController. firstly, it's just confusing. secondly, because of it's naming laravel can't resolve related policy (IDK why exactly)
- refactor nearest chunks resolving (right now it's horrible. its like O(n^8), dunno how to fix, but must do something)
- implement file storage (avatar uploading), couldn't accomplish in two first days
- refactor PointService, right now its just garbage
- seeders and factories

---broadcasting via websockets, laravel reverb
- event when:
    new point created (only if you can see this point)
    updating point (only if you can see this point)
    deleting point
